# ColonistMod
ColonistMod is a [Harmony mod](https://harmony.pardeike.net/articles/intro.html) for the game Old World.

The mod adds a new unit named Colonist, which can be consumed to build the Colony improvement. The colony improvement provides an alternate method of expansion. The territory is granted to your nearest city.
